# Morphometric_classification_kangaroo_bones
Traditional morphometric analysis and classification of three bones from the macropod pes.

Specimen identification is the backbone of archeozoological research. The challenge of differentiating postcranial skeletal elements 
of closely related wild animals in biodiverse regions can prove a barrier to understanding past human foraging behaviours. Morphometrics 
are increasingly being employed to classify paleozoological animal remains, however, the potential of these methods to discriminate 
between wild animal groups has yet to be fully realised. Here we demonstrate the applicability of a traditional morphometric approach to 
taxonomically classify foot and ankle bones of kangaroos, a large and highly diverse marsupial family. Using multiple discriminant analysis, 
we classify archaeological specimens from Boodie Cave, in northwest Australia and identify the presence of two locally extinct macropod 
species during the terminal Pleistocene. The appearance of the banded hare-wallaby and northern nail-tail wallaby in the Pilbara region at 
this time provides independent evidence of the ecological and human responses to a changing climate at the end of the last Ice Age. 
Traditional morphometrics provides an accessible, inexpensive, and non-destructive tool for paleozoological specimen classification and has 
substantial potential for applications to other diverse wild faunas.
